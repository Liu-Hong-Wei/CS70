# CS70: Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory
This repository contains all course available materials from UCB CS70 2024 Spring, you can check the [official website](https://www.eecs70.org/) to learn more!
## introduction
This is Berkeley's introductory discrete mathematics course. The biggest highlight of this course is that it not only teaches you theoretical knowledge, but also introduce the applications of theoretical knowledge in practical algorithms in each module. In this way, students majoring in CS can understand the essence of theoretical knowledge and use it in practice rather than struggle with cold formal mathematical symbols.

Specific theory-algorithm correspondences are listed below.

- Logic proof: stable matching algorithm
- Graph theory: network topology design
- Basic number theory: RSA algorithm
- Polynomial ring: error-correcting code design
- Probability theory: Hash table design, load balancing, etc.

The course [notes](https://github.com/Liu-Hong-Wei/UCB-CS70-Spring-2024-Course-Materials/tree/main/notes) are also written in a very in-depth manner, with derivations of formulas and practical examples, providing a good reading experience.
